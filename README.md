# Surf's Up!
Wanting to create a new life in Hawaii where waves and ice cream are the order of the day we start this viability analysis. Surf and Shake Shop ... here we come!!

# Overview of the analysis
To validate the investment that would be required to transform our vision to reality, we needed to analyze the weather for different locations and across different seasons.  Questions as to; is it warm enough, is it consistently warm enough, what would be our high season, etc. need to be answered.  Using data from a hawaii weather station database we performed the analysis to get this vital information.

# Results: 
For the question of peak season, June is definitly the month!  Here are a few points that came from the analysis:
* High temps:  June has a max temp of 85 deg, while Dec comes in with a max of 83 deg
* Average temps: June wins again with 75 deg, while Dec has an average temp of 71 deg
* Low temps:  Both June and Dec had low temperatures that might impact business on those days.  June had a low of 64 deg and Dec's low was down to a chilly 56 deg

# Summary: 
There is good data available in the analysis we completed.  There are enough datapoints to have a good confidence in the data, with 1700 in June and 1517 for the month of December.

Mid-summer and mid-winter show daytime highs which are high enough to surf (you may need a wetsuit) and even enjoy ice cream on those warmer days!  

## Further Analysis Opportunities

### Location, location, location
An additional query could be performed to gather the June and December data for specific weather stations.   This would provide some insight if certain areas of the island had higher highs and lows than others.  This analysis would help to drive the decision as to which specific location would be best for the Surf and Ice Cream shop.

### Rain, rain go away
Another query would be to query location and percipitation (prcp).  Sunny and wet won't drive ice cream sales.  This percipitaiton information along with the location tempserature analysis mentioned above will be the final piece of analysis to confirm the ideal hot and dry location for our new business.
